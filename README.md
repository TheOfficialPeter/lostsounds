> Just something i needed myself and so I wanted to make it... 

I have always loved listen to this very specific genre of music that gives me the futurisitc optimism vibes and I hated opening up youtube, spotify every time i wanted to listen to it so instead I just baked it all into a website to shuffle this genre of music and start playing it immediately.
